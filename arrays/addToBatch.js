// You are helping your friend, who owns a candies business, with their website. Every order placed on the website gets assigned an order ID, such as 1274.

// Your friend would like to create batches of five order IDs. They ask you if you could give a hand and write a small program to do this.

// To complete this exercise you will have to find out:

// how to add elements to an array with the .concat method
// how to get the length of an array
// Questions
// Declare a function addToBatch that takes two arguments, an array and a number, and returns a new array by adding the number to the array.
// Now, make sure this function does not add the number if the array's length is already 5 or greater â€” it should just return the array untouched in that case.

const addToBatch = (batch, num) => {
  if (batch.length >= 5) {
    return batch;
  }

  return batch.concat(num);
};

console.log(addToBatch([1], 3));
console.log(addToBatch([1, 2, 3], 4));
console.log(addToBatch([], 8));
console.log(addToBatch([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 7));
console.log(addToBatch([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 10));
